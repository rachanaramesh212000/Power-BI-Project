# 🕵🏻‍♀️Credit Card Fraud Risk Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

## 🔍 Project Overview

**Problem Statment**

Credit card fraud leads to significant financial losses and harms customer trust. The goal of this project is to identify transaction patterns associated with fraudulent behavior, prioritize high‑risk segments (customers, merchants, card types, banks, locations), and provide a dashboard that business and risk teams can use to monitor and respond to fraud in near real‑time.

**Objective**
Build a **clean, well-structured Power BI model** that:


1. Profile fraudulent vs non‑fraudulent transactions and compute key fraud KPIs.

2. Identify top fraud types, high‑risk states, merchants, banks and card types.

3. Build visual dashboards to communicate findings to stakeholders.

4. Suggest operational rules or features useful for a real‑time fraud detection pipeline.
